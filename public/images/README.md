# Public Images Folder

This folder is for static assets that don't need processing:

## Video Files

- **hero-turbo.mp4** - Hero section video (should be optimized, <2MB if possible)

## Note

- Images should go in `src/assets/` for Astro optimization
- Videos should go here in `public/images/` since Astro's Image component only handles images
- Static files in `/public` are served as-is
